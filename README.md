# test-llm-app: Hello World Blue Background Page

## Project Summary

This project creates a very simple, single-page web application that displays the classic "Hello World" message on a solid blue background. It's designed to be a fundamental demonstration of basic HTML and CSS capabilities, all contained within a single `index.html` file without relying on external assets or complex JavaScript.

## Setup Instructions

This application is exceptionally easy to set up and run:

1.  **Save the file:** Copy the provided `index.html` content and save it as `index.html` on your local machine.
2.  **Open in browser:** Double-click the `index.html` file, or open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) and navigate to the file path (e.g., `file:///path/to/your/index.html`).

That's it! No build tools, servers, or dependencies are required.

## Usage Guide

Upon opening the `index.html` file in your web browser, you will see a full-screen webpage. The entire background of the page will be blue, and the text "Hello World" will be prominently displayed in white, centered both horizontally and vertically on the screen.

There are no interactive elements or further actions required from the user. It is a static display.

## Code Explanation

The entire application is self-contained within a single `index.html` file, adhering to the single-page application requirement.

*   **HTML Structure (`index.html`)**:
    *   The `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags define the standard structure of an HTML document.
    *   `<meta charset="UTF-8">` and `<meta name="viewport"...>` ensure proper character encoding and responsive behavior across devices.
    *   `<title>Hello World App</title>` sets the title that appears in the browser tab.
    *   A `<div>` with the class `hello-container` holds the "Hello World" text. This provides a target for applying specific styles to the text content.
*   **CSS Styling (`<style>` tag in `<head>`)**:
    *   The CSS is embedded directly within a `<style>` block in the `<head>` section of the HTML file.
    *   `body` styles:
        *   `margin: 0; padding: 0;` removes default browser margins/padding, ensuring the background covers the entire viewport.
        *   `font-family: Arial, sans-serif;` sets a common, readable font.
        *   `display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;` uses CSS Flexbox to perfectly center the content ("Hello World") both horizontally and vertically within the page.
        *   `min-height: 100vh;` makes sure the body element stretches to at least the full height of the browser viewport.
        *   `background-color: blue;` sets the required blue background for the entire page.
        *   `color: white;` sets the text color to white for optimal contrast against the blue background.
        *   `font-size: 3em;` makes the "Hello World" text large and easily visible.
        *   `text-align: center;` ensures the text itself is centered within its container, especially if it were to wrap.
    *   `.hello-container` styles:
        *   `padding: 20px;` adds some internal spacing around the text.
        *   `text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);` adds an optional subtle shadow to the text, enhancing its readability and visual appeal.
*   **JavaScript (`<script>` tag at the end of `<body>`)**:
    *   A `<script>` block is included at the end of the `<body>`. For this particular task, no JavaScript is functionally required as there's no dynamic behavior. The block is present for completeness, demonstrating where client-side scripting would be placed if needed. A simple `console.log` message confirms the script area is loaded.

No CDN links are used as no external libraries (like Bootstrap, Marked, Highlight.js) are necessary for this simple demonstration.
